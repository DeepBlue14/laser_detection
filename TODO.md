###**TODO**

**Algorithm**

*On start*

- motion    (find moving regions)
- size      (which ARE the most correct size to be a laser point?)
- color     (which ONE is the best color?)



*Post Start*

- motion    (find moving regions)
- size      (which ARE the most correct size to be a laser point?)
- color     (which ONE IS the BEST color?)
- loc       (how far is it from the laser in the previous frame)











**Components**

- motion
- color
- size
- loc (distance from last laser location)

**Assumtions && Notes**

- This is one and only one laser on at all times (if the laser is not on, don't run the software)
- Due to the limitations of the sensors, this algorithm is partially based on "which is the best fit", NOT "which fits some exact specifications"
