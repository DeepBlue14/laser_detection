###**TODO**

- Check OpenCV's ```dialate``` and ```erode``` functions.
- Connect **color**, **shape**, and **motion** detection *(running in parallel)*
- Link up link in MotionDetection.h file about contours; it may be useful for shape detection *(i.e. a circular point)*
- Try HSV color model
- May have to modify the topic queues to keep the processes relatively in sinc.
